This is a personal website project in which I will create a static website to promote the products I sell and my business.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Love this idea for your PWP. Do you currently own a botanical supplement brand? Keep in mind that an eCommerce site is way out-of-scope for PWP - but a single-page site that is a complementary presence to your e-retail outlet, a site that provides information or educational material regarding your products, and/or helps drive traffic is a great idea. Going forward, I see that this project will require an expanded scope that includes additional technology to support more interactive functionality.

Excellent work on your Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona and Use Case. You understand the needs of your end user clearly. I would like a little more information in your Use Case regarding how Barbara intends to use your site specifically... is she looking for more information about a specific product you offer, information about your company in general, or is she looking to contact you about something in particular? I also note that your Persona is outlined as a mobile user, so designing a mobile UI that is both elegant and intuitive sounds like it should be a primary concern.

Your project is set up according to spec, and your HTML looks great. Nice work. Your PWP Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin work on Milestone 2a.  

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- It's considered proper to include a `<title>` in your HTML `<head>` tag.

This is a good start, but I think that your layout and design choices could use a little more refinement and detail before you begin coding.

These wireframes are actually approaching mockup territory with their use of color and imagery. I'm not certain how committed you are to these specific design choices, but I think that they could use some refinement for a more professional look and feel. One resource I like to browse from time to time is [themeforest.net](https://themeforest.net/). This site sells templates for a variety of different platforms. It gives you an idea for what's selling right now in terms of themes and designs. My biggest concern with the design choices you have here is that there is too much busy imagery that can steal emphasis away from your content.

But before you explore graphic design choices... I'm going to advise you to add additional detail regarding the strucutre of  the content on your page. Especially since you plan to feature content about numerous plants and herbs in the Ethnobotanicals section. How do you plan to format this data so it's clear and engaging to the user? You _could_ just feature paragraph after paragraph of plain text... but there are probably more effective design choices you could implement.

Will you be featuring images along with your text content? Would iconography help parts of your content stand out? Would organizing the content into panel regions, a grid, columns, or thumbnails be more effective or more organized? I don't have clear cut answers for you, but I encourage you to explore this before you begin coding. Take a look at other websites and note any design choices you find appealing. The following Bootstrap components could also be of help:
- http://getbootstrap.com/components/#thumbnails-custom-content
- http://getbootstrap.com/components/#panels-heading

The more content you plan to feature the more critical the layout choices become. What black-and-white wireframes allow you to do is create a solid structure for the content without getting distracted or mislead by design choices. The graphic design then becomes complimentary to the underlying content structure (wireframe), and enhances and strengthens it - doesn't compete with it. I think that's one of the things that is bugging me about the design... the background imagery seems to be competing with the content, and that actually weakens the visual impact of the site. Just a thought.

Look at some Flexbox CSS to get your grid quandrants formatted on desktop screens. Have a look at this handy guide here: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

Based on your content strategy - it sounds like you might be planning to feature enough content to necessitate a "long scroll" down the page. If this is the case, you may want to think of featuring some navigation links so a user can jump to different sections more easily.

The ideas you have here can be implemented well - with varying degrees of complexity. What I recommend is a simple approach  with some additional detail for the Ethnobotantical content, and refinement of the design choices before you begin. I think this will be a big help to you when you start development. I'm also more than happy to help you source solutions to complex challenges during your development phase, and even put together examples in complex cases.

I totally recommend FontAwesome for iconography, and Google Fonts for custom typography.

Overall - very nice work. Your HTML looks great too. Your Milestone 2a passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are clear to begin development on your PWP. You'll want to build your PWP page in the following location: `public_html/index.php`, and the next Milestone will be a mid-development checkin.
