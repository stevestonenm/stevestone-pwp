This is a personal website project in which I will create a static website to promote the products I sell and my business.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Love this idea for your PWP. Do you currently own a botanical supplement brand? Keep in mind that an eCommerce site is way out-of-scope for PWP - but a single-page site that is a complementary presence to your e-retail outlet, a site that provides information or educational material regarding your products, and/or helps drive traffic is a great idea. Going forward, I see that this project will require an expanded scope that includes additional technology to support more interactive functionality.

Excellent work on your Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona and Use Case. You understand the needs of your end user clearly. I would like a little more information in your Use Case regarding how Barbara intends to use your site specifically... is she looking for more information about a specific product you offer, information about your company in general, or is she looking to contact you about something in particular? I also note that your Persona is outlined as a mobile user, so designing a mobile UI that is both elegant and intuitive sounds like it should be a primary concern.

Your project is set up according to spec, and your HTML looks great. Nice work. Your PWP Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin work on Milestone 2a.  

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- It's considered proper to include a `<title>` in your HTML `<head>` tag.
