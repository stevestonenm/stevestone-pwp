		<h1>Persona</h1>
		<p><strong>Name:</strong>Barbara O'Malley<br>
			<strong>Age:</strong>44<br></p>
		<p><strong>Profession:</strong>Office Manager at a large retail chain</p>
		<p><strong>Technology:</strong>Uses her desktop ar work day in and day out to keep up with the flow of all
			necessary paperwork that is sent and received from the corporate office.  Most of her work experience is with
			Microsoft Office Suite but she does use a few other programs to scan, edit, and send documents. Outside of work,
			she is frequently on her iPhone7 looking and Facebook and Instagram, her age group is the largest age group on
			Facebook. She also uses her phone to complete most of her online shopping.</p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong>She has been a long time sufferer of back pain and has been taking
			pain medication for years. As she has gotten older she has started to research more natural options for pain
			relief. Through her research she has discovered that nature provides people with an abundance of plants and
			herbs that can be used to enhance and improve the quality of life for many people.</p>
		<p><strong>Frustrations:</strong>As she has become more interested in botanicals, Barbara she has found it hard to
			find some of the less well known plants and herbs. She can go down to her local all natural grocery and find 15
			differnt brands of echinacea with golden seal but cannot find shilajit or rooibos tea. She has been buying her
			needs on line but most of the websites she has been using are outdated and difficult to navigate.</p>
		<p><strong>Goals:</strong>Barbara wants to find a website that is easy to navigate and provides good information
			about the products they carry. Customer service is also important to her. She wants to be able to actually get
			a response from a real person if she contacts the business.</p>
		<p><strong>User Story:</strong>She wants to be able to have multiple options for here pain management and wants to
			purchase from someone with knowledge about the products they sell.</p>
		<h1>Use Case</h1>
		<p>Barbara spends most of her time at working sitting at her desk. Although she gets up and walks a bit every hour,
			her back pain is definitely noticeable at the end of the day. She has been living with chronic back pain for 15
			years and has been prescribed pain medication for most of those 15 years. Recently, she has started to experiment
			with natural alternatives to her pain medication.  Through trial and error, to her amazement, she has been able
			to find a few natural alternatives that will help manage her pain. She still takes her pain medication when needed
			but natural alternatives have allowed her step back the amount she has been taking. And since she has had great
			success with natural alternatives she is always wanting to learn more about plants and herbs and is on the lookout
			for new things to experiment with.</p>
